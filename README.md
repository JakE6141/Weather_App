This is a simple java program that uses java swing for the gui components and a weather API to get the background data. This is my first time using a API so for the first part I followed a tutorial so that I could fully 
understand how the API is being connected to the interface. After that was done I added the pm2.5 tracker as well, this was great practice of using APIs since I had to get the data from a different end point for the particulate matter. 
I will definitly be doing more API projects in the future as I feel this brings a large amount of usage to the code. For the future I want to add a O2 tracker as well and update the interface so you can move screens,
similar to how moible devices operate.
